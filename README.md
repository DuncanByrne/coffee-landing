# coffee-landing

Link to the working site https://duncanbyrne.github.io/coffee-landing/#


This is a quick website simulating a landing page for a coffee shop that is obviously not Starbucks. This is just the landing page so right now the menu button does not
lead anywhere. I made this with simple HTML and CSS.
